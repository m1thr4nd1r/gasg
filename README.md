##Genetic Algorithm for String Generation
=======

The idea behind this project is to use genetic algorithms to generate a string given by the user. It has some configuration files included, that are needed by heroku, and was initially writen on PHP, although a NodeSQL migration were in the works.

The code isn't 100% functional, something must have passed by me that keeps the code from running correctly. So, for now, this code has been discontinued, however its open to anyone that wants to use it :)
